# Profile Dictionary #
This simple add-on makes it possible to create profile-specific dictionaries for NVDA.
To make use of the add-on, just select the profile you want a dictionary for, and press NVDA+shift+p. The normal NVDA dictionary dialog will open for you to add entries valid only for the active profile (the profile name should appear somewhere in the dialog title).
Note that you can not associate a profile dictionary to NVDA's normal configuration.
The default add-on shortcut can be changed through NVDA's input gestures dialog: under configuration node, expand the node that says "Shows the profile-specific dictionary dialog".
